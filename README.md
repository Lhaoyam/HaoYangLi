Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-stranded, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Hepatovirus in the family Flaviviridae, which is mainly transmitted through blood. There is currently no effective vaccine against HCV, and CD8+ T and CD4+ T cells have been found to have a prominent role in inhibiting HCV transmission. We would like to be able to identify linear T-cell epitopes of hepatitis C virus by sequence information alone prior to vaccine development. We developed a a predictor TCellPredX for identifying linear T-cell epitopes of hepatitis C virus. We used a total of 12 machine learning models (ADA, DT, ET, KNN, LGBM, LR, MLP, NB, PLS, RF, SVM and XGB) and 13 features (AAC, AAI, APAAC, CTDC, CTDD, CTDT, DDE, DPC, PAAC, PCP, TPC, ESM_2 and PortT5). Firstly multiple models are integrated into one integrated model using average voting, and a predictor TCellPredX is trained by fusing multiple features and using maximum correlation minimum redundancy (mRMR) for feature selection , and the feature-selected features are put into the integrated model for training.The development of TCellPredX is important for the suppression of the spread of hepatitis C virus.
